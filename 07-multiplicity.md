## Phase 5: Multiplicity

You've reached the point where you have multiple projects, tons of revenue coming in, and there's no signs of it stopping. However, as a one-person team, it has become difficult to manage projects, complete your assignments and continue marketing yourself to keep projects on the horizon for when others are finished. It's time to expand. Hiring people can be a daunting task, but bringing people on board can help you reach a new level of success and freedom.

#### Hiring Others

There are a number of ways you can begin to expand your workforce as your company begins to grow. For some projects, it may make sense to bring in a part-time contractor to take on some of the work. For others, it may be time to hire someone full-time to help work with you in fulfilling requests and helping expand your business.

**What to look for when hiring employees**

1. Hire people who are like-minded and as passionate as you.
2. Find people who are competent and can help bring other skills to your team.
3. Look for employees who can help you build a culture around your team.
4. Compensation is a big part of the hiring process, so ensure that they are comfortable with a market-competitive salary and benefits package.

**What to look for when hiring contractors**

1. Review their work to ensure they are competent to complete the tasks they will be given.
2. Be sure they are comfortable fitting into your current workflow and can bring value to the final product.
3. Check their references to see if they've met milestones in the past and are flexible within your own timelines.
4. Their compensation will largely depend on the full extent of the project, so be certain they fit within your budgetary means.

If you are based in the U.S., the Small Business Administration provides a very thorough [walkthrough](http://www.sba.gov/content/hire-your-first-employee) of the things you need to accomplish when hiring your first employee. These steps will help prepare you for setting up tax withholdings and providing your employee with everything they need to begin working for you.

If you are planning to hire a contractor to help out, you can check out some [requirements](http://www.sba.gov/content/hire-contractor-or-employee) you'll need to account for to stay legal.

#### Building Products

With another person on your team or a full staff, you now have the ability to build on the products you've began along with continuing your client work. Many great companies have started out as client-based and then shifted to become fully reliant on their own products to support the revenue goals, such as [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/about) and [Coudal Partners](http://www.coudal.com/).

As you begin to plan out yearly projections, be sure to include your own personal projects and products into the time you will allocate. Essentially, you become your own client. Devote time and resources each week to fulfilling your goals. Manage your own products as you would any client's, setting up timelines, milestones and releases.

It's also good to ensure everyone on the team is on the same page about the plans for the products you are creating. If you think it's a great idea, but the rest of your team is hesitant, it may result in a flawed product. Be honest with each other, and share your thoughts on the things you are building in order to keep communication open. By agreeing to build strong products, you will be a better company in the long-run. Having buy-in from everyone on staff makes for a better work environment too.

With more people on your team, you also can have more ideas that could generate more revenue for your company. Be open to listening and potentially building some of the ideas of your employees.

#### Generating Passive Income

Earn while you sleep. Products you build can generate revenue without having to focus 100% of your time and effort on them. Generating passive income can allow you to continue increase your staff and give you more time to grow your business, or create new products. While you will have to support these products, you can find many other ways to earn without having to work 24/7.

1. **Write a book**: You are an expert in something. You have a wealth of knowledge to share, and can do so by writing about your experiences and providing some expertise to people willing to learn and pay for it.
2. **Sell ads on your blog**: Once you begin to gain traction in your teachings and musings online, you can begin to sell ads on your blog to generate some additional cash.
3. **Create an app**: While it's never guaranteed that you'll make a ton of money selling an app, it could turn out to be a big success and help you profit without having to do much. Build an app that people will pay for, launch it and watch the money roll in.
4. **Selling your work**: Sites like [ThemeForest](http://themeforest.net/) and [CodeCanyon](http://codecanyon.net/) allow you to sell your work and make money. While it will require your time to answer support emails and provide updates, many people have enjoyed success from selling their work to the masses. Whether it's a template, design mockups or some of your custom-baked code, you can profit by simplying sharing your work.

Remember, that while this could be considered 'passive income', you have to make sure you keep these items updated in order to continue earning money while you sleep.
