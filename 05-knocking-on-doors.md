## Phase 3: Start knocking on doors

You've built a website that showcases your personality, writing and work. You've contributed to open source projects and have publicized your personal projects on social media platforms and forums. By this point, you should have started to define your audience and planted the seeds for traction, though you may not have any customers yet. When you are starting out as a freelancer, it's important to recognize your audience, but you may not yet have the luxury to exclusively sell to your audience. Revenue is a freelancer's life-blood, and the bottom-line is that you have to start generating it in order to achieve your ultimate goals. There are lots of sites that promote contract work for developers and designers, and while they are often hyper-competitive, they are a good place to start as a new freelancer with a limited reputation for creating value for customers. Here are some places to look for work:
