## Phase 0: Handling your business

We call this Phase 0 because even though you *have* a business, it doesn't mean you *run* a business. The topics in this section are meant to outline the administrative considerations for starting a freelancing business.

> Note, the topics in this phase represent our opinions. When it comes to matters of personal finances, taxes, benefits, etc. you should find qualified professionals to help you. Use the information in this section as a general starting point to learn more, but please be diligent about finding experts that you trust. Also note that the topics around incorporation and taxes may have different implications depending on the state and country you live in. Read carefully, but speak to an expert in your state and country before making any definitive decisions.

#### Incorporation

If you Google "incorporating as a freelancer" you'll find a variety of advice and opinions. While you do not need to incorporate yourself as a business, it can present some benefits. Most importantly, incorporation can afford you with tax and liability protection that you would otherwise not have access to. The most common types of incorporation in the US for freelancers are [sole proprietorships](http://www.sba.gov/content/sole-proprietorship-0) and [LLCs](http://www.sba.gov/content/limited-liability-company-llc).

#### Tax Concerns

Being self-employed presents certain tax concerns that are not of consequence to regular (W2) employees. As a sole-proprietor, member of an LLC, or owner of some other corporate vehicle in the US, you are [considered to be self-employed by the IRS](http://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-%26-Self-Employed/Self-Employed-Individuals-Tax-Center). One of the big differences in your tax liability will be your obligation to pay estimated taxes on a quarterly basis to avoid penalties at the end of the year.

Being self-employed also affords you certain benefits that you would not have as a W2 employee. For example, you'll be able to [deduct qualified expenses](https://lessaccounting.com/blog/small-business-tax-tips/), thus lowering your overall tax liability. Tax laws can be very complex, and they change often. It's a good idea to find an accountant you can trust, who has experience working with small business owners. Accountants may not be as expensive as you think. Unless your tax situation is especially complicated, you should be able to keep your accounting expenses to less than $1,000 per year. Before you start searching for an accountant on the Internet, check with your personal network to see if anyone you know has recommendations. Franchises like [H&R Block](http://www.hrblock.com/) might be a safe option, but sometimes you'll realize more benefits from working with a certified public accountant, or CPA.

#### Health Care

W2 employees usually get a full benefits package that includes health care, life and disability insurance and a retirement plan. As a business owner you may need to cover some or all of these things yourself. If you have a spouse with a health insurance plan from their company, you can probably join their plan, but for the sake of this guide let's assume that you are doing everything on your own.

Health care is a complex subject, but a good place to start is [understanding the basics and how the US government can help you](https://lessaccounting.com/health-insurance/understanding-obamacare/). No matter what age you are, health care should be a top concern. Your health is your ability to earn a living and be happy, so even if you're 25 and feel indestructible (you're not), you need solid coverage. Find a health care plan that fits your lifestyle and covers you both preventively and in the case of emergencies.

#### Insurance

Insurance is another important topic that you may have taken for granted if you worked at companies that offered it as part of their default benefits package. There are many types of insurance, and once again, you should speak with a professional to learn what's best for you. As a starting point, you may want to consider [disability insurance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disability_insurance) for yourself, so that if something happens to you that limits your ability to work, an insurance company will pay part or all of the salary that you are no longer able to earn. If you have a family that depends on you, you may want to consider a [life insurance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_insurance) policy. A life insurance policy is typically paid to its beneficiaries (like a spouse or children) in the event of your death. Having a policy that pays your family enough to cover outstanding debt (like a mortgage) and at least a few years of your would-be earnings is a reasonable strategy. Insurance plans are typically long-term commitments and to get the best policies for your unique situation will require working with a trustworthy and experienced insurance broker. In this respect, it's best to check with your personal networks for recommendations.

You may want also want to consider [professional liability insurance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Professional_liability_insurance), which can help to protect you in the case of a client suing you for negligence. This may sound far-fetched (it most likely will be), but that's the point of insurance: to cover you when the unexpected happens. Don't let the thought of being sued scare you away from freelancing. Even if you get hired for a highly sensitive project, simply being honest, diligent and friendly with your client at every step will go a long way in making sure that nothing takes them by surprise. In his 2005 book [Blink](http://gladwell.com/blink/), [Malcolm Gladwell](http://gladwell.com/) explains [why doctors get sued for malpractice](http://ethicalnag.org/2010/10/15/why-doctors-get-sued/). His research shows that doctors get sued more often because of their unfriendly demeanor and lack of empathy, rather than the product of their actual work. This is not an excuse to perform shoddy work if you're a nice person, but rather a case to always be empathic with your clients. Basically, people rarely sue other people that they like - so be nice.

#### Retirement

Retirement is another largely complex topic that you should seek professional guidance for. That being said, invest all your money in [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org). -- We're joking, we're joking. Two general rules you should consider when creating your retirement strategy: invest early and diversify. Being self-employed entitles you to establish and contribute to a [SEP IRA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SEP-IRA). If you qualify for a [Roth IRA](http://www.rothira.com/), you should consider that as well, as it offers tax-free income after you retire. [This article explains some retirement advice for freelancers](http://money.usnews.com/money/personal-finance/investing/articles/2009/06/04/retirement-advice-for-freelancers), but once again, find a credible institution and advisor to work with. Believe it or not, you may not want to be forced to code for profit when you're 85. By then you'll just be working on open-source for the love of it, of course.

#### Legal Eagles

As a small business owner you won't need access to a full-time lawyer. That being said, it's helpful to have a lawyer around when you have questions about contracts, invoices and payment terms. It's important to meet a lawyer you can trust to help you out in a pinch. For this type of legal service you should be able to pay by the hour, or work off a small [retainer agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retainer_agreement). Here's a brief guide on [hiring a small business attorney](https://lessaccounting.com/blog/hire-small-business-attorney/).

#### Banking

If you plan to incorporate your freelance business, you should consider getting another bank account to keep your personal and business finances separate. [Choosing the right bank](http://blog.microlancer.com/banking-for-freelancers/) can be its own process, as each one has specific terms and costs associated with them. As a freelancer, it’s important to spend less time worrying about dealing with the bank, so finding one that’s easy to work with and has a great reputation can alleviate the pain. Separating your business expenses from your personal account also makes accounting easier for tax purposes.

#### Accounting Systems

As we mentioned in the Tax Concerns section, you should find a trusted accountant to work with you on your taxes. The accountant won't do all the work though - you'll be responsible for your own book-keeping. Fortunately, book-keeping is largely a solved problem. There are tons of accounting tools out there. [Less Accounting](https://lessaccounting.com/) and [Fresh Books](http://www.freshbooks.com/) are two products that allow you to track income and expenses, connect bank accounts and credit cards, generate invoices, track time, among other things. Both products offer a monthly subscription and free trial.

#### Pricing Yourself

As your own boss you have the luxury to set your salary. Unfortunately, earning your salary is contingent on clients willing to pay it. There is no exact science in pricing yourself, but there are guidelines to follow. First of all, you need to know what your *safe zone* is. A safe zone is a small range that allows you to maintain a consistent standard of living. Your safe zone must respect the context of your industry though, so while $300 per hour might be a reasonable safe zone for an experienced defense attorney, it's not realistic for a new developer or designer. (Keep coding and designing though, and $300 per hour might not be out of the question). Let's say your safe zone as a new designer or developer is $40 - $50 per hour. If you can find around 30 hours of work per week, that should come out to approximately $70,000 per year in revenue. For this to be your safe zone you need to be confident in your ability to bring in 30 hours of work per week and know that you can maintain your standard of living for $70,000 per year.

#### All that to start freelancing, are you kidding me?

We covered a lot in this section, and that was at a high level. The topics above are not necessarily prerequisites to start freelancing, but they are topics that you should understand and consider. Once you gain an understanding of these topics, and find trusted advisors and institutions to work with, much of the above can be set to auto-pilot for the most part. The piece of mind you'll gain from being responsible about taxes, retirement, insurance, etc. will enable you to immerse yourself in projects and crank out high quality work. Freelancing can be a blast, and in the next section we'll start getting into the fun stuff.
