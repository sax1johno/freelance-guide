## You weren't meant to have a boss

> Though they're statistically abnormal, startup founders seem to be working in a way that's more natural for humans.

_**Paul Graham**, in his essay [You weren't meant to have a boss](http://www.paulgraham.com/boss.html)_

Though freelancing isn't the same thing as founding a startup, both endeavors share a lot in common. Above all else, as a freelancer or founder, you're responsible for your own livelihood. You don't kill, you don't eat. While founding a startup can be great, freelancing can be a great lifestyle business as well as a great way to bootstrap a startup. Freelancing affords you independence, flexibility and a great sense of satisfaction. Additionally, experienced freelancers can earn more, *much more* than salaried employees who work at companies. That being said, freelancing can also be scary. You won't always have the benefit of a steady paycheck, you may have to find your own benefits, and you have to deal with administration that for most is a mundane task. Fortunately, the painful tasks associated with freelancing can be minimized or eliminated, so that you can focus on doing the work that you want. We'll cover all of these things in this guide and help you launch as a freelancer.
