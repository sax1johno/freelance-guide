## Phase 4: I don't need your stinking work

Now you have some contracts under your belt. You've generated revenue and have received positive reviews from your client. You have some subscribers to your blog and are starting to build an audience. Offers are coming, though you are still forced to accept work for the money as your options are still somewhat limited. This is all great, it means that your methods are working, and your growth graph is heading in the right direction. The best thing to do is to stay the course, and take on all the work you can handle. You want to widen your base and figure out your most marketable niche before you zero-in on a very specific audience. Here are some tips to take you to the next phase.

#### Managing Multiple Clients

Once you have numerous clients under your belt, you may be managing several projects at once. This is a good problem to have, but make sure it doesn't get out of control.

Never take on more work than you can handle. In the great words of NBC sitcom 'Parks & Rec' character Ron Swanson:

> "Never half-ass two things, whole-ass one thing."

Give each client the attention they need through the duration of their project, (ensure) you complete tasks when deadlines are set, and (keep) an open line of communication when adjustments need to be made. If this means 20 hours a week, that opens up some time to take on additional clients.

By keeping your projects and clients organized, you can help met your clients' expectations and your goals. Several online tools can be used to manage your projects and clients, like:

As you continue to grow, you'll find — or even build — software that helps structure your workflow and eases the pain of managing multiple clients and projects at once.

Effective and consistent communication is required to make sure everyone is happy with the work being produced. Never become unresponsive to a client without explanation, as it could cause issues to arise.

#### Staying Productive

Time management is key in working with clients, especially when you have more than one at any current time. Staying productive means producing work when it's due and meeting the demands of your clients while not burning yourself out.

Keep track of your day and how the time is spent on each project you are focused on. Plan out your time accordingly for the upcoming weeks — or even months — so that you have a full understanding of where your time and energy will be devoted to going forward.

Set deadlines for yourself. Focus on hitting those deadlines, as well as the ones your client may set for you.

#### Cash Flow Concerns

Clients first have to pay you, which means you may have to wait sometimes to get paid. Meanwhile, you still have to pay the bills. As a freelancer, you have to manage your cash flow to make sure you get paid, but also have money to pay any debts you may have accrued in the process of running your business.

When we talk about cash flow, we're not referring to the money in your account. Most of the time, those monies are allocated for your business expenses, such as your own payroll, office space, internet access, software costs and much more. So the money in your account may not be reflective of what needs to be paid out.

Businesses fail when the cash runs out. So to be successful, you need to set up cash flow projections so you have a clear goal in mind. Determine how much your cash balance should be in 3 months, 6 months and even possibly a year from now. These aren't clear definites, but mere educated guesses. They can change based on your clients' ability to pay their bill on time as well as other factors that may arise in your own expenses.

#### Raising Your Rates

As you continue growing and learning, you'll need to accommodate to prepare for the future. One way to do so is by raising your rates. Inflation and other things can help drive the need to do so, but before this happens, you have to prepare your clients.

Develop a strategy for your new rates, and share it with your clients. Explain the factors that went into your decisions and provide a timeline of when this will be implemented so they are aware beforehand.

Be confident in your decision to raise your rates. Explain the value you add to their companies. Educate them prior to raising your rates too. Giving them ample notice before doing so can help ease the process.

It costs more to acquire new clients than to keep current ones. So try and sweeten the deal by providing discounts or additional discounted services to them to keep them happy. If they decide to walk away, it's likely they see your value differently than you do.

#### Firing Clients

You may come to odds with a client or two during your time as a freelancer. It's not uncommon for either party to become unsatisfied with the work being completed or the overall collaboration between you and the client. Just as they have the ability to let you go of your duties, you can also fire your clients — pending the details of the contract you agreed to, of course.

Walking away from clients is often a scary situation, but may result in more happiness if the environment isn't ideal. Be sure to give them notice in advance when you plan to part ways, in order to give them time to find a replacement or transition them to another provider.

#### Finding Better Projects

Quality is better than quantity. While it's great to have a ton of clients and projects, some projects are just better than others. As you freelance and grow your business, you'll be able to separate the great projects from the mediocre.

As you search for better projects, keep strict guidelines in mind for agreeing to work on projects. Don't settle for things just to pass the time — unless you are having cash flow problems. Adhere to a new set of standards you set for yourself in selecting projects to work on.
