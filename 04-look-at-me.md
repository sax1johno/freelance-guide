## Phase 2: Look at Me!

At this point you should have a professional-looking web site to build on. You may not have any work yet, but that's because we haven't started speaking into the megaphone yet. The table is set, we just need people to come sit down, here are some ways to invite them.

1. Blog early, blog often, blog about anything. When nobody knows who you are, you need to put yourself out there. We'll talk about shippings projects and contributing to open source, but first and foremost you need to write. Not everyone can appreciate a beautifully crafted open source Gem, but most people will be able to appreciate well-written prose. Your blogs should be mostly about the industry you are freelancing in - books you read, projects you are working on, tutorials you've developed, conferences you've attended, etc. You should also consider other topics - sports, travel, hobbies, etc. If you're a developer who also blogs about tennis, do you think that might strike a nerve with a perspective client who loves tennis? Absolutely! You may want to stay away from hot-button topics like politics and religion though. Some people are easily offended and our opinion is that those topics are too personal to involve in your professional life. Then again, if you don't give a hoot, have it and let everyone know how you feel about communists.

2. Design or build an app...any app. Create a to-do list, create a Twitter clone, create AirBnB for dogs: the idea doesn't matter as much as the completion of it. The point is to begin to show off your chops. If you can think of an idea that's actually useful, even better - leveraging APIs like [Twitter](https://dev.twitter.com/) and [Github](http://developer.github.com/) are often helpful for this.

3. Write a Gem, plugin, template or anything that could help other people develop applications. Redesign an existing site, create templates for an iPhone app, or make a UI kit for free download. Once again, the idea is not as important as simply shipping something. You could write a Gem that handles email verification, or create the simplest CSS framework known to man - all that matters is getting something out there. The more you put stuff out there, the more ideas will come to you, and it will become easier to think of ideas that are actually useful to others. Of course, it also shows perspective clients that you can do more than patch together code for an application. Extracting concepts into reusable software shows that you have a deeper understanding of your craft.

4. Going back to #3, blog about the things you create. Perhaps you can even turn them into tutorials so others can learn. Want to go the extra mile? - Create a screencast demonstrating how you published you Gem, deployed your app or designed the UI kit. People will find this useful, and it shows that you can effectively explain complicated topics. Clients will be much more likely to hire you if you can demonstrate yourself as an effective communicator.

5. **Developers:** Start searching [Code Triage](http://codetriage.com) and find an open source project you're interested in and able to help with. The point is to get your name out there and get involved with other people's projects. -- People *will* start to notice you if you become an active OS contributor. If you can contribute to popular projects, there's a good chance that your perspective clients are already using them. If a client sees that you're an active contributor to software that they in fact use, you'll have a lot of leverage in negotiating a contract. Some of our mentors have pointed to open source contributions as their top revenue generator.

6. **Designers:** Find a [local non-profit](http://greatnonprofits.org/) and reach out to them with a pro-bono opportunity to redesign their current web site. While you can donate your time and skills to help, it also allows you to continue building your portfolio to show off to potential clients and provides a nice challenge for you to keep developing your talents.

7. Get involved. Even though most freelancers work alone and remotely, doesn't mean you have to feel alone. Freelancers have banded together to form many meetups, conferences and support groups. You'll be well-served to find some groups that you're comfortable with and start meeting fellow freelancers. Other freelancers may end up being one of your top inbound sources for new opportunities.
