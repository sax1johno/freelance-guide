## Phase 1: Launch

> Who are you and what are you doing here?

If you're offering a professional service, these are fair questions. The answers to these questions are not complicated, but they do need to be thought out. For example, if you were to answer these questions with:

> I'm a web developer and I'm here to build your website.

You're barking up the wrong tree. A customer does not hire you because you're a web developer or they want their website rebuilt. A customer hires you to improve their business. Finding the right answer to these questions depend on two things: what you are selling and who you are selling it to.

#### Defining your audience

Your audience is who you sell to. As a new freelancer you're not going to be building an enterprise accounting system for a Fortune 500 company. Fortune 500 companies are *not* a part of your audience.

Your audience starts with who *you* are. Are you a recreational sports fanatic? If so, take a look at the website of one of your local city's leagues. There's a good chance it could be improved, and as someone who understands the league as a customer, you're uniquely qualified to improve it. Sports not your thing? That's cool, what about animals? Do you care enough about homeless animals to make it easier for good people to adopt them? There are animal adoption agencies everywhere and they all have websites that could be improved or rebuilt. Do you have a professional background in another industry? Perhaps you are a lawyer who decided to take down their shingle and start building websites. As a former lawyer you're uniquely qualified to improve law firm websites and online services.

Defining your audience is not complicated, just think about your own interests, experience and abilities. You'll do your best work when you're working on something that you care about anyhow. Your audience will grow over time, but you have to start somewhere. You're not going to get rich by converting animal adoption sites to Rails, but that's not the point in this phase. The point is to define your audience and start building a portfolio.

#### What are you selling?

You may be a software developer or designer by trade, but that's not important to your audience. A customer in your audience will hire you to deliver a result. With the exception of non-profit work, customers will only hire you if they believe *the result you provide will be worth more than the fee they pay you*. This is also known as a return on investment, or [ROI](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp). Customers don't care what your title is, they are hiring you to solve a problem that they believe is costing them money. As Patrick McKenzie [explains](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2011/10/28/dont-call-yourself-a-programmer/), you are selling **business value**, and that's what the customer is buying.

Coming back to our original question:

> Who are you and what are you doing here?

Perhaps a better answer is:

> My name is Bill, and I'm going to increase the value of your business by bringing more people to your website.

#### Creating your website

Knowing what you sell and who you are selling it to is a huge step to building a successful freelancing business - it means you've essentially found your market fit. But you still need to promote yourself otherwise your defined audience will never know you exist. The best way to start promoting your business is to create an Internet presence. Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn profiles are fine, but a freelancer's most important marketing tool is their own website. Not only should your website serve as a portfolio of work you've done, but it should speak to the quality of your work itself. Remember, you are selling your ability to create great websites, so your website should be a representation of that ability.

Instead of building a website with a tool like [SquareSpace](http://squarespace.com/), craft it from scratch. It will take longer to build but it will reflect your tastes better. Make your portfolio a digital representation of what you stand for as a professional. The colors, layout, copy and navigation links should all be unique. Of course there are proven best-practices for crafting nice looking sites with persuasive copy, but before you worry about those things just make a site that your best friend would recognize as a reflection of you.

When choosing a domain name for your website, consider a name that clearly represents you, or your business name. If you can, try to get a `.com` top-level domain. If you're not sure what to use, start with your own name. Successful freelancers like [Brennan Dunn](http://brennandunn.com) and [Nathan Barry](http://nathanbarry.com) use their names as their domains, while [Patrick McKenzie](https://twitter.com/patio11) uses a recognizable business name in [Kalzumeus](http://www.kalzumeus.com/).

#### Home page

Your website should have a home page that clearly states who you are and what you do. The goal of your home page should be to articulate the essence of your business in 30 seconds or less. Your home page should also have a clear [call to action](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_to_action_(marketing)). The call to action will depend on your audience, but it could be a gateway to an email list or a free consultation, for example. The purpose of the call to action is to move a perspective customer closer to being an actual customer, also known as the [purchase funnel](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchase_funnel). We'll cover funnels and sales later in the guide.

#### Blog

A blog is a great way display your creativity and personality. Your writing can impress a prospective client as much as a portfolio of projects. You should feel free to write about anything on your blog, but keep your audience in mind as well. Blog posts are a great way to bring traffic to your website in general, so make sure you distribute your posts on relevant social and forum sites. If you're struggling to find a topic to start writing on, just start writing about your process of building a freelance business. Not only will other prospective freelancers find it interesting, but it shows clients that you take your business seriously.

#### Portfolio

Include a page dedicated for your best projects. Include links to the source code and the production URLs. Think about including a short background story for each project. You surely had a purpose for building it, so share that. If you created a simple to-do list, just to expose yourself to [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/), explain why you wanted to try Meteor and why you think it's a useful (or not useful) technology.

#### Deploy the [MVP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product)
Building a professional website is not a simple task that can be done overnight. Your site will evolve over time. Launching your site without a blog or portfolio is fine (you will need a homepage though!), but continue to iterate on your site each week, as you learn more about your audience and have more content and projects to share. Remember what Reid Hoffman [said](http://startupquote.com/post/855482768):

> If you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product, you've launched too late.

Your web site will be your most important product as a freelancer, so it's wise to get something out there quickly, then iterate like crazy after you receive feedback and analyze results.
